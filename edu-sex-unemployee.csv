Note(s):,,,,,,,,
"Number of persons are rounded to the nearest hundred.Figures in the table may not add up to the total due to rounding.For annual estimates less than 1 000 and quarterly estimates less than 3 000, they should be interpreted with caution due to relatively large sampling error.Starting from 2001, annual figures are compiled based on the survey results of the General Household Survey from January to December of the year concerned as well as the mid-year population estimates.",,,,,,,,
"1 Unemployed persons refer to those persons aged 15 and over who fulfil the following conditions :(a) have not had a job and have not performed any work for pay or profit during the 7 days before enumeration;(b) have been available for work during the 7 days before enumeration; and(c) have sought work during the 30 days before enumeration.However, if a person aged 15 or over fulfils the conditions (a) and (b) above but has not sought work during the 30 days before enumeration because he/she believes that work is not available, he/she is still classified as unemployed, being regarded as a so-called ""discouraged worker"".Notwithstanding the above, the following types of persons are also classified as unemployed :(a) persons without a job, have sought work but have not been available for work because of temporary sickness; and(b) persons without a job, have been available for work but have not sought work because they :(i) have made arrangements to take up a new job or to start business on a subsequent date; or(ii) were expecting to return to their original jobs. Unemployed persons with a previous job by previous industry/occupation do not include first-time job-seekers and re-entrants into the labour force who were unemployed as information on previous industry/occupation of these persons is not available.",,,,,,,,
2 Unemployment rate refers to the proportion of unemployed persons in the labour force.,,,,,,,,
"3 Educational attainment refers to the highest level of education ever attained by a person in school or other educational institution, regardless of whether he/she had completed the course. Only formal courses are counted as educational attainment.",,,,,,,,
